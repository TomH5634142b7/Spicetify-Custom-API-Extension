# Spicetify Custom API Extension
This extension was built to integrate the Stream Deck into Spotify without needing to use the Spotify Web API.

Click [here](https://github.com/TomH5634142b7/Spotify-Integration-Stream-Deck-Plugin) for the Spotify integration Stream Deck plugin.

## Why?
The Web API is good, but it has its pitfalls.

You have to always be online and the existing Windows Spotify plugin is always gonna be delayed by a second to ensure they don't get rate-limited.

Because of this, I decided to make this extension to go with the Stream Deck plugin.

## Why not use WebNowPlaying?
Using WebNowPlaying was my original goal, but I later realised this may cause issues with Rainmeter because there's no easy way to integrate them all together when they all use the same port.
